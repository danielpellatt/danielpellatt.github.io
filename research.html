<h3 id="jmp">PAC-Bayesian Treatment Allocation Under Budget Constraints</h3>
<h4> <a href="{{site.url}}/assets/pdfs/dpellat_jmp.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Download Job Market Paper</span></a></h4>
<div>This paper considers the estimation of treatment assignment rules when the policy 
  maker faces a general budget or resource constraint.  Utilizing the PAC-Bayesian 
  framework, we propose new treatment assignment rules that allow for flexible 
  notions of treatment outcome, treatment cost, and a budget constraint.  For example, 
  the constraint setting allows for cost-savings, when the costs of non-treatment exceed 
  those of treatment for a subpopulation, to be factored into the budget. It also 
  accommodates simpler settings, such as quantity constraints, and doesn't require 
  outcome responses and costs to have the same unit of measurement.  Importantly, 
  the approach accounts for settings where budget or resource limitations may 
  preclude treating all that can benefit, where costs may vary with individual 
  characteristics, and where there may be uncertainty regarding the cost of 
  treatment rules of interest.  Despite the nomenclature, our theoretical analysis 
  examines frequentist properties of the proposed rules.  For stochastic rules that 
  typically approach budget-penalized empirical welfare maximizing policies in 
  larger samples, we derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds for the 
  target population costs and sharp oracle-type inequalities that compare 
  the rules' welfare regret to that of optimal policies in relevant budget categories.  
  A closely related, non-stochastic, model aggregation treatment assignment rule is 
  shown to inherit desirable attributes.</div>

<h3>Binary Forecast and Decision Rules via PAC Bayesian Model Aggregation</h3>
<h4> <a href="{{site.url}}/assets/pdfs/Pellatt_Sun_Binary_Fcast_PacBayes.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Download</span></a></h4>
<div>We consider a PAC-Bayesian model aggregation approach to binary decision or
  forecast rules when different decision-outcome pairs may have asymmetric 
  payoffs that can vary with observed covariates. The
  approach estimates a probability distribution over a class of models from
  which majority vote or stochastic decision rules can be derived. Adopting a
  utility-based measure of loss considered in \cite{GrangerMachina}, we show the
  PAC-Bayesian methodology is well suited to this setting. Non-asymptotic
  training sample bounds and oracle inequalities familiar in form to
  counterparts from the 0/1-loss literature are derived for the utility-based
  setting. The decision rules perform competitively in simulation experiments,
  achieving higher expected utility than several methods proposed in recent
  literature. The approach is also well suited to data-rich modeling
  environments; a constrained version of the learning algorithm produces
  utility-oriented decision rules with similarities to support vector machines.</div>
